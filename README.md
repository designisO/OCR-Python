# Working with OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

Opticial Character Recognition allows you to recognize text from within a documnent or image. For this project, I was able to use the EasyOCR library as well as OpenCV to detect the text on a image. PyTorch was also introduced using torchvision and torchaudio. 

### Installed Packages
!pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

!pip install easyocr
